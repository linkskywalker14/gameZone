## Nick's Game Zone â€” Pig Dice & Tic Tac Toe in Javascript

The purpose of this project is primarily to learn how to employ Objects and Prototype Functions in Javascript. As a secondary goal, I wanted to set myself a project I could settle into. One which would prompt me to learn a variety of new techniques, and which would be openended enough to be expanded upon in future as I learn more. 

### Challenges

- Development was disrupted several times by outside factors. Other project obligations required that I spend weeks away from coding, which then required I completely reacquaint myself with the project when I returned to it.
- Devising a means by which the computer could track & respond to the Tic Tac Toe game state was difficult. The solution I landed on has significantly more hardcoded 9-option decision trees than I like. This resulted in code that is significantly lengthier and less flexible than I think it ought to be. In retrospect, my purposes may have been much better served by paying heed to the project's primary goal of employing objects and prototype functions. I will not now undertake such an extensive rewrite as that would require, but may do so in future. 

### Future Expansion

Though they are currently outside the scope of this project, there are several additional features I'd like to add if I return to it.

- On the home page, it would be nice if the image of the person at the arcade machine changed to represent the different games as the mouse moved to hover over each option. 
- On Tic Tac Toe, I'd like to add a 3rd level AI which runs two passes through the BlockCheck function: first to see if there's a possible win, and only if there is not, to see if there is a possible block.
- On Tic Tac Toe, I'd like an option to set the size of the board, such that players could play _Connect Four_ if they wanted. The current infrstracutre isn't flexible enough to support this, and would likely require a complete rewrite.
