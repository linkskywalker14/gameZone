## Name of Project

Nick's Game Zone â€” Pig Dice & Tic Tac Toe in Javascript

### Method

The purpose of this project was to learn to use Objects and Prototype functions in Javascript. 

### Challenges

The purpose of this project is to put what I've learned recently into practice. 

- Development was disrupted several times by outside factors, which required I completely reacquaint myself with the project each time I returned to it. 
- Another thing
- There probably ought to be three things.

### Extension

Though they are currently outside the scope of this project, there are several additional features I'd like to add if I return to it.

- On the home page, it would be nice if the image of the person at the arcade machine changed to represent the different games as the mouse moved to hover over each option. 
- On Tic Tac Toe, I'd like to add a 3rd level AI which runs two passes through the BlockCheck function: first to see if there's a possible win, and only if there is not, to see if there is a possible block.
- On Tic Tac Toe, I'd like an option to set the size of the board, such that players could play connect four if they wanted. The current infrstracutre isn't flexible enough to support this, and would likely require a complete rewrite.
