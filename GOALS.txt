Pig dice should display actual dice, using only two images: a blank die, and a pip image that is replicated and displayed as many times as is appropriate.

Link multiple JS files together so as not to repeat unecessary code. 

Two AI difficulty levels for each game.

A cheating button for PigDice that lets you "load" your dice, so every result but 1 has double the usual chance of appearing. 

Option to play with AI *or* with another human playing locally
